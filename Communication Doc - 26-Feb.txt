Always make sure that our implementations are aligned with dynamic and scaled architecture , also aligned with business requirements document
Take your time for handling implemementations , also get 360 degrees analysis to make sure changes or new implementations wouldnt affect other modules
Always provide complete files, except when changes are easy to apply to the existing file
Clearly indicate file names and locations for easier implementation
Follow the existing project patterns and approaches
Ask before implementing features beyond what you've explicitly requested
Recommendations are welcome but should be presented as options rather than implementations
Controllers shouldnt have any business logic inside
Break Down Large Tasks and ask clarifying questions when needed
Think step by step and how reasoning and take your time for complex matters , also give examples when applicable
